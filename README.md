# CDK CORS Utilities

Provides utilities to configure CORS for [Amazon API Gateway (API Gateway)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/welcome.html) with [AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/home.html).

## For whom is this library?

This library would help you if you feel tiresome of repeating CORS settings for API Gateway with CDK.

## Background

When I describe a REST API with API Gateway, I often write a couple of utility functions to deal with CORS.
These functions are quite simple though, I no longer want to prepare them everytime I start a new project.

## How to install

Please add this repository to your Node dependencies.

```sh
npm install https://github.com/codemonger-io/cdk-cors-utils.git#v0.1.0
```

The installed module will be available as `cdk2-cors-utils` like the following,

```js
import { makeIntegrationResponsesAllowCors } from 'cdk2-cors-utils';
```

This library is designed for CDK v2.x, and does not work with CDK v1.x.

## APIs

Please refer to [`api-docs/markdown/index.md`](./api-docs/markdown/index.md).

## Examples

TBD

## Development

### Transpiling TypeScript files

`build` script transplies TypeScript files in the `src` folder.

```sh
npm run build
```

You will find transpiled JavaScript (`*.js`) and type declaration (`*.d.ts`) files created in a folder `dist`.

### Generating API documentation

`doc` script generates the API documentation.

```sh
npm run doc
```

You will find markdown files updated in the folder `api-docs/markdown`.
Documentation is generated by [API Extractor](https://api-extractor.com) and [API Documenter](https://api-extractor.com/pages/setup/generating_docs/).
